## Description

GestureX is a Python application that recognizes hand gestures using a webcam and maps them to custom commands making the interaction with your computer more intuitive, fun and inclusive. The application provides a real-time preview of the webcam feed with hand gesture recognition. It is easily configurable through a graphical user interface and supports multiple camera sources.

    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python3 gui.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running the `gui.py` script;
2. Set the camera source and the desired hand gesture commands in the graphical user interface;
3. Perform the hand gestures in front of the webcam to trigger the mapped commands and interact with your computer;
4. (Optional) Import the `gestures_commands.json` file to get sample bindings to test the app.

## Supported Hand Gestures

| Hand Gesture Name | Gesture |
|-------------------|---------|
| Okay              | üëå      |
| Peace             | ‚úåÔ∏è      |
| Thumbs Up         | üëç      |
| Thumbs Down       | üëé      |
| Call Me           | ü§ô      |
| Stop              | ‚úã      |
| Rock and Roll     | ü§ò      |
| Fist Bump         | üëä      |
| Smile Hand        | üëâ      |
| Live Long         | üññ      |

These are the default gestures recognized by the model I am currently using. I am also working on the possibility of adding your custom gestures and on the support for dynamic gestures. If you have any suggestions or want to contribute to the project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

# Installation Problems

## Debian

If pip won't install PyGObject because pycairo is missing, you should check if you have the `libgtk-4-dev` package installed.
If python complains about missing `cv2`, you'll need the `python3-opencv` package. Afterwards rebuild the venv.
